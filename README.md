# NbaOutcomes
This repo contains code that predicts the outcomes of a particular matchup in the NBA based on 2024-2025 data. 



The predict_total directory contains code that prints out our current guesses for the total for the day's games (it takes a while to run code.py)

For predict_total to work, must run the following in order each new day: 

- run the script get_reg.py
- run the script nba.py
- then run code.py
